# Linear Regression from Scratch

This project is a clean, beginner-friendly implementation of **Linear Regression using only NumPy**, aimed at helping learners understand the fundamental building blocks of one of the most essential machine learning algorithms — without relying on external ML libraries like scikit-learn.

It walks through how a machine "learns" the best-fitting line using **gradient descent**, and explains the role of the **cost function**, **parameters**, and **convergence** — all accompanied by visualizations.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Generation** – Synthetic linear data is created for demonstration.
2. **Visualization** – The dataset is plotted to show the relationship.
3. **Model Implementation** – Linear regression is implemented using NumPy:
   - Parameter initialization
   - Cost function (MSE)
   - Gradient descent algorithm
4. **Training the Model** – Iteratively adjust weights using gradient descent.
5. **Plotting** – Show the fitted line and loss reduction.

## Tech Used
